        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>16 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved</li>

            <li>8 ounces spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>4 cups greens, such as <i>arugula, baby spinach, and/or Swiss chard</i></li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>basil leaves, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan or kettle.</li>
            <li>Place tomatoes, garlic, oil, and salt in a large deep skillet or Dutch oven. Place spaghetti noodles on top and add lemon zest. Place skillet over medium heat. </li>
